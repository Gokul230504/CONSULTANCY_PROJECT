# CONSULTANCY_PROJECT
Developed by Gokul Raj L, Jashima Hasin J, and Khaushik B S for V-Guard Industries consultancy work, this system enhances industrial safety by monitoring wind speed, direction, temperature, and humidity. It provides real-time data and early fire alerts, leveraging IoT for prompt intervention and risk mitigation.
Precision Environmental Monitoring System for Wind Analysis

This project, developed by Gokul Raj L, Jashima Hasin J, and Khaushik B S, aims to create a precision environmental monitoring system designed to track critical weather factors such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and humidity in industrial settings. The primary goal is to enhance safety by providing early alerts, particularly during fire incidents where wind conditions can exacerbate the spread of fire.

Objective and Scope

The project's objective is to develop a system that continuously collects and analyzes weather data to improve safety protocols in industrial environments. This system is especially crucial during emergencies like fires, where quick and informed decision-making is vital to prevent escalation and ensure the safety of personnel and assets.

Components and Methodology

The proposed system integrates several components:

Anemometer: Measures wind speed accurately.
Wind Vane: Detects wind direction using a mechanism of ball bearings and metal components.
DHT22 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity with high precision.
Arduino Uno: Serves as the central processing unit, managing data collection and processing from sensors.
LCD Display: Shows real-time data for immediate analysis and response.
IoT Integration: Uses platforms like Blynk for remote monitoring and data access via web-based or mobile interfaces.
Functionality

The system employs simple yet efficient tools to gather continuous weather data. In case of a fire, it detects sudden temperature increases, triggering early alerts for prompt intervention. This proactive monitoring helps mitigate risks and enhances safety protocols, thereby safeguarding both personnel and property.

Advantages

Real-time Monitoring: Provides continuous data collection and real-time alerts.
Accuracy: High precision sensors ensure reliable data.
User-friendly: Designed to be accessible even to those unfamiliar with advanced technology, making it suitable for use in various industrial settings, including rural areas.
Operational Continuity: Helps prevent accidents and property damage, ensuring smooth industrial operations.
Conclusion

The Precision Environmental Monitoring System for Wind Analysis is an innovative solution aimed at enhancing industrial safety through advanced weather monitoring and early fire detection. By leveraging modern technology and IoT, the system provides an efficient and accessible means to safeguard industrial environments, ultimately benefiting workers and industries alike.
